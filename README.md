This repo contains a simple bash script that will download a file from rapidgator.net.

To use this, you will need an account of rapidgator and the email and password added to a .env file:

```
email="email_address.com"
password="abc123"
```

Then you can download a file by running:

```
./get.sh https://rapidgator.net/file/filename.html
```
